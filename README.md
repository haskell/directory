Building from Git repository
----------------------------

When building this package directly from the Git repository, one must run
`autoreconf -fi` to generate the `configure` script needed by `cabal
configure`.  This requires [Autoconf][ac] to be installed.

    autoreconf -fi
    cabal install

There is no need to run the `configure` script manually however, as `cabal
configure` does that automatically.
