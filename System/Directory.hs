{- $intro
A directory contains a series of entries, each of which is a named
reference to a file system object (file, directory etc.).  Some
entries may be hidden, inaccessible, or have some administrative
function (e.g. @.@ or @..@ under
<http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399 POSIX>), but in
this standard all such entries are considered to form part of the
directory contents. Entries in sub-directories are not, however,
considered to form part of the directory contents.

Each file system object is referenced by a /path/.  There is
normally at least one absolute path to each file system object.  In
some operating systems, it may also be possible to have paths which
are relative to the current directory.

Unless otherwise documented:

* 'IO' operations in this package may throw any 'IOError'.  No other types of
  exceptions shall be thrown.

* The list of possible 'IOErrorType's in the API documentation is not
  exhaustive.  The full list may vary by platform and/or evolve over time.

-- Permissions

{- $permissions

directory offers a limited (and quirky) interface for reading and setting file
and directory permissions; see 'getPermissions' and 'setPermissions' for a
discussion of their limitations.  Because permissions are very difficult to
implement portably across different platforms, users who wish to do more
sophisticated things with permissions are advised to use other,
platform-specific libraries instead.  For example, if you are only interested
in permissions on POSIX-like platforms,
<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/unix/docs/System-Posix-Files.html unix>
offers much more flexibility.

 The 'Permissions' type is used to record whether certain operations are
 permissible on a file\/directory. 'getPermissions' and 'setPermissions'
 get and set these permissions, respectively. Permissions apply both to
 files and directories. For directories, the executable field will be
 'False', and for files the searchable field will be 'False'. Note that
 directories may be searchable without being readable, if permission has
 been given to use them as part of a path, but not to examine the
 directory contents.

Note that to change some, but not all permissions, a construct on the following lines must be used.

>  makeReadable f = do
>     p <- getPermissions f
>     setPermissions f (p {readable = True})

-- | Make a path absolute, normalize the path, and remove as many indirections

-- the path is canonicalized.
--
-- __Note__: This function is a very big hammer.  If you only need an absolute
-- path, 'makeAbsolute' is sufficient for removing dependence on the current
-- working directory.
--
-- Indirections include the two special directories @.@ and @..@, as well as
-- any symbolic links (and junction points on Windows).  The input path need
-- not point to an existing file or directory.  Canonicalization is performed
-- on the longest prefix of the path that points to an existing file or
-- directory.  The remaining portion of the path that does not point to an
-- existing file or directory will still be normalized, but case
-- canonicalization and indirection removal are skipped as they are impossible
-- to do on a nonexistent path.
--
-- Most programs should not worry about the canonicity of a path.  In
-- particular, despite the name, the function does not truly guarantee
-- canonicity of the returned path due to the presence of hard links, mount
-- points, etc.
--
-- If the path points to an existing file or directory, then the output path
-- shall also point to the same file or directory, subject to the condition
-- that the relevant parts of the file system do not change while the function
-- is still running.  In other words, the function is definitively not atomic.
-- The results can be utterly wrong if the portions of the path change while
-- this function is running.
--
-- Since some indirections (symbolic links on all systems, @..@ on non-Windows
-- systems, and junction points on Windows) are dependent on the state of the
-- existing filesystem, the function can only make a conservative attempt by
-- removing such indirections from the longest prefix of the path that still
-- points to an existing file or directory.
--
-- Note that on Windows parent directories @..@ are always fully expanded
-- before the symbolic links, as consistent with the rest of the Windows API
-- (such as @GetFullPathName@).  In contrast, on POSIX systems parent
-- directories @..@ are expanded alongside symbolic links from left to right.
-- To put this more concretely: if @L@ is a symbolic link for @R/P@, then on
-- Windows @L\\..@ refers to @.@, whereas on other operating systems @L/..@
-- refers to @R@.
--
-- Similar to 'System.FilePath.normalise', passing an empty path is equivalent
-- to passing the current directory.
--
-- @canonicalizePath@ can resolve at least 64 indirections in a single path,
-- more than what is supported by most operating systems.  Therefore, it may
-- return the fully resolved path even though the operating system itself
-- would have long given up.
--
-- On Windows XP or earlier systems, junction expansion is not performed due
-- to their lack of @GetFinalPathNameByHandle@.
--
-- /Changes since 1.2.3.0:/ The function has been altered to be more robust
-- and has the same exception behavior as 'makeAbsolute'.
--
-- /Changes since 1.3.0.0:/ The function no longer preserves the trailing path
